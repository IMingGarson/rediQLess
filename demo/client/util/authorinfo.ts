		info: `Me in nutshell? I am a veteran of the Air Force, a former elementary school teacher, a father of boy/girl twins, and a husband. I love to travel and I have been to 25 countries and 5 continents. I love to watch movies, I am a sucker for Marvel movies, I love to find new places to eat, and I love to find new science fiction/ fantasy fiction whether it is movies or literature.
		Specifically about software engineering, I love to learn new technologies, frameworks, and libraries. I enjoy tackling projects for work and for fun. I have worked in and lead an agile/SCRUM model of production. I really like to touch all areas of the life cycle of planning, designing, implementing, testing, deploying, and maintaining a project. I hope you have gained some insight into me as a person and a software engineer.`,
